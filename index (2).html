            <h2>what is Anime?</h2>
            <p>
                According to the Japanese concept of anime,
                 this term is used to classify all types of 
                 animation, that is, regardless of their origin 
                 (national or foreign). The origin of the word anime
                  is uncertain. Some researchers consider it to be an 
                abbreviation of the English animation (“animation”),
                 while others argue that it may have emerged from the 
                 French animée (“animated”). Anime can be of numerous 
                 different types, such as children's, horror, romance, comedy, adventure, erotic,
                  science fiction, etc.
